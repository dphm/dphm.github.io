I was seven when I created my first email address: daniellepham7@hotmail.com. In hindsight it was super reckless to reveal my identity so soon, but I had no idea what the consequences could be. I met people on MSN chatrooms who claimed to be around my age. Who knows who those people were‽ It's pure luck that I didn't find myself in any creepy situations. Seriously, teach kids about online safety.

My dad was fascinated by new technology. He was born before World War II ended, so I'm sure he's witnessed lots of significant advancements. I don't know how he learned about the Internet or what he thought it would be useful for, but by the early 2000s we had Internet at our house. I have the slightest memory of Netscape and dial-up. We soon switched to cable, and my brother and I each ended up with our own computers. Over the years, we ruined a few by getting Trojan viruses probably from installing dumb software like BonziBUDDY, and overheating our video cards from playing MMORPGs.

During elementary school, I made some awful websites on a forum called CalgaryPlanet where users would send each other "cows", and on Neopets where I spent hours playing flash games. I wrote stories with my friends over MSN Messenger that we pasted into Word documents. I frequented Oekaki boards, where people could draw using a browser Java applet and post their art for comments. I made friends there and on DeviantArt, some whom I consider to still be my very close friends after more than a decade.

I went through a bunch of different social media sites: Myspace, hi5, Nexopia, Friendster. In high school, I settled on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I was especially open with my friends on Tumblr, where I wrote about my thoughts and feelings. I happened to meet my current long-term partner on Tumblr after someone I followed for Montréal photos reblogged a photo he took. My friends understood me best when I communicated with them online.

Over time, I shared less about myself on the Internet. Family members and acquaintances were adding me on Facebook, and I found it tedious to specify permissions for my posts. I didn't enjoy the character limit or community on Twitter. I was harassed anonymously on Tumblr, and became obsessed with removing old posts that I no longer liked. I started to edit my content carefully. Eventually, I stopped posting altogether.

My life became opaque, especially for the friends I left behind when I moved away. I went dark because I was afraid of judgment. Nobody knew what I was up to for months at a time. I got used to the lack of self-expression. I'm still having a hard time coming out of it.

I just want to have my own space on the Internet. Social networks are not giving me the freedom I need to explore who I am and what my honest values and opinions are. I'm tired of omitting everything because I don't want to disappoint people like my parents. I want to be honest. I want to be genuine.

So, I'm trying to carve this space out here. You might end up reading something you didn't expect that changes your perception of who I am. That's okay. I hope I end up doing that too.
