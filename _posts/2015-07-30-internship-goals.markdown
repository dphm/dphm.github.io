*Progress:* **////**////// (37.5%)

I've already been working at Shopify for a month and a half. Time flies when you're *having fun* and *getting shit done*! 

I had two one-on-one meetings with my team lead so far. We talked a bit about documenting my work to learn more deeply, and to have a solid sense of what I accomplish over the internship.

Making the best of the rest of my internship takes some planning. I don't want to set unrealistic expectations, but I don't want to meander for too long without a direction. Here are some things I intend to do:

- **Write** technical posts about how I think stuff works
- **Update** content and mental model after getting feedback on posts
- **Keep** notes as I read [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/)
- **Develop** informed opinions instead of following trends blindly
- **Give** valuable code reviews that do more than scratch the surface
- **Share** ideas/challenges more openly during team meetings

The main idea is for me to understand things thoroughly enough to talk about them. It's challenging. It will take practice. If it makes me a better developer with every step, I'm going to do it. One day, I'll help someone else be a better developer too.
