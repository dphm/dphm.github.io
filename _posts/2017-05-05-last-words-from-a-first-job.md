I recently left my first job as a software developer at [Shopify](http://shopify.com), after six months as an intern plus sixteen months full-time. The decision didn't come easily to me, but I'll discuss my reasons in a future post.

For now, I'd like to thank the individuals who took the time to respond to my resignation email. Over two-thirds of just over thirty undisclosed recipients reached out to let me know how they felt. Many were really sad to see me go, but wished me well and respected my choices.

A few people wrote heartwarming messages, which I'm going to hold close when I'm feeling uncertain:

---

> Thanks for everything you put into Shopify!! You’re awesome. You’ll do badass things for sure.

---

> I’d really like to thank you for helping all of us during your time here.

---

> I had a bunch of fun working with you and I’m sure you’ll do incredible things whatever you end up doing next.

---

> It was a pleasure working with you. Much respect to you for taking a bold step in searching for what will bring personal meaning and happiness to your life.

---

> You are extremely smart and it was a pleasure being part of your journey at Shopify.

---

> In the short time we worked together I could quickly see you are a very gifted individual and a wonderful person. You will be missed!

---

> I really enjoyed working with you. You have great potential, and are a very good team player. You are very young and have a long career path ahead of you that you can adjust however you like.

---

> You’ve got a bright future and infinite possibilities.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to my growth in any way. I've learned so much from working with talented individuals who care deeply about their crafts, and established meaningful connections with people who encourage my technical and personal growth. I'm extremely grateful for this opportunity, and excited for the road ahead!
