Someone asks you to work on something you've never done before. It sounds like a daunting task, and you don't have a whole lot of context about the problem domain. What do you do?

I don't have a perfect answer, but I've been learning to deal with this situation every week for the past month. This is my process; your mileage may vary, but I hope this will be useful nonetheless.

## 1. Stay calm

Not knowing how to do something can be scary, especially if someone is paying you for it. The important thing to realize is that the person asking you to do the task believes you are capable. You may not *feel* qualified, but you are capable. Nobody expects you to know everything. If you did, there wouldn't be any room for improvement.

## 2. Know what you want to achieve

Do you have a clear idea of what you want to change? Clarify expectations. You may have a different idea of what you need to do than what actually needs to be done. Maybe you're thinking way too far ahead and you think you need to do everything at once, when the problem is meant to be broken down into small stages or components.

## 3. Know your resources

You don't have to go through everything alone. Talk to people who have more experience with the problem you're trying to solve. Keep in mind that they also had to learn about the same concepts at some point. Try not to ask them how to do things. Instead, they might be able to explain how the system currently works, what the desired outcome is, and what some good first steps may be. Integrate their domain-specific knowledge with your own skills and experience. Ask them questions if you don't quite understand what they mean. Questions aren't only going to benefit you; they can prompt others to articulate their ideas in a clearer way.

## 4. Investigate a little at a time

Maybe your project is huge, and you don't know how everything works. Take some time to fiddle around: observe values by logging or using a debugger. Follow function calls as if you were writing a stack trace. Keep track of what these functions do. Sketch out simple diagrams of how you imagine the interactions of different pieces. If you're not sure about your mental model, ask someone if you've got the right idea. They can help you get on track if you're not already on it.

## 5. Test as you change things

I may not have a ton of experience with writing automated tests, but I do check my work manually to the best of my ability. Is what you're writing doing what you expect it to? If not, why not? You won't be able to catch everything by doing manual checks, but this may give you an idea of what you should be validating in your test cases.

## 6. Don't stay stuck for too long

If you find yourself going in circles without any results for an unreasonable amount of time, take a break. Discuss the problem with others. Even if they don't know the technical details, they still may be able to give useful feedback and ideas. Come back to the problem with a fresh perspective.

## 7. Get feedback

It's not always feasible to do everything right the first time. Others may have seen similar patterns that come with experience and practice. They can help you restructure, or point out some details you may not have considered. Think about what they are suggesting. Does it make sense to you? Do you agree with the approach they have in mind? Do you think it should be done differently? Have you reasoned about why you agree or disagree? Have a discussion if there are different ways to do something and it isn't clear which is most appropriate. (Also, give feedback. You might have a perspective that hasn't been considered yet!)

## Summary

You can do it! Someone believes in you! Ask for help! Have discussions! [Never give up!](https://youtu.be/KxGRhd_iWuE)
