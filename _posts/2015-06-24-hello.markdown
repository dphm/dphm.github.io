I'm coming to a new chapter in my life &mdash; one that I'd been nervous about for the past few years. What would it be like to go out into the *real* world after spending so much time in school? Who would I be in this new environment?

The transition from school to work has been easier than I expected, thanks to Shopify's two weeks of onboarding. My group is one of the first to participate in this new program. Last week, I gained genuine appreciation for the product by using it myself to make a test store. I listened to recorded support calls, amazed by the breadth of knowledge a Shopify Guru must have. I spent the weekend at a lakeside cottage with amazing interns and chaperones. This week, I've been watching talks on culture and processes, and doing some codelabs.

I go home every day feeling like I was paid to have fun and eat good food. Everyone is kind and willing to help. I knew I would enjoy working at Shopify, but I didn't quite know I'd enjoy it this much.
