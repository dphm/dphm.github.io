_I change over time._

## My mother named me _Danielle_

My mother, a Roman Catholic, phoned a friend and chose _Danielle_, the feminine version of the biblical Hebrew name, _Daniel_. _Daniel_ means "God is my judge," and in his story he survived in a lion's den and didn't abandon his trust in God.

I don't believe in God, so maybe I don't think anyone should judge me and expect to get any value out of it. What aspects of me are they judging? I change over time.

### Deadnames

I'm not speaking on behalf of other trans people, who very often have valid reasons for not wanting to be [deadnamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming).

I'd like to accept my younger self, who was [assigned female at birth](https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/AFAB), socialized as a girl, and referred to as _Danielle_ (or _Danii/Dani_ to different people at different times). _Danielle_ didn't have the language to describe gender dysphoria, didn't find representation, and didn't have the space to experiment until adulthood.

## _D_ was a placeholder

It actually started as _d_ because I felt more like a _lowercase_ person until I confronted myself about my ideas of self-worth. Then I became _D_. I was mainly aiming to remove gender from my name to reduce the chances of people making assumptions about my femininity before attempting to get to know me.

Some people and software systems were confused, and didn't consider _D_ to be a valid name. I received UPS packages where the sender had to double the _D_. Who decided that a first name requires a length of at least two Latin characters?

I knew I wasn't going to be _D_ forever, I just didn't know what name I felt connected to, so I waited.

## Time

My brain was still active after finishing _Minor Feelings_ by [Cathy Park Hong](http://www.cathyparkhong.com/books). I thought about the impending name collision when my coworker Di would return from parental leave. After thinking of a handful of options, Delta came to me, and I felt a moment of pure [gender euphoria](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_Euphoria) and excitement.

## Delta represents change

I read _Parable of the Sower_ by Octavia E. Butler, in which Lauren Olamina writes, "God is change." Again, I don't believe in God, but I do have my own way of connecting to something beyond myself.

The universe is vastly complex: creative, destructive, transformative. I believe I came to exist by coincidence, by some particular circumstances governed by the nature of physics and entropy. I am what I am through processes of evolution and adaptation of the human species over generations.

I'm also a math nerd, and triangles are tastier. Δ ■

## You, me, and others

### What if you still call me _Danielle/Danii/Dani/D_?

I don't control your actions, and you can choose to do whatever you please, but not without consequences. I view the acceptance and use of my chosen name as an act of care. If I were to insist on calling you by a name you didn't feel connected to, you might also feel disconnected from me.

I've outgrown these names like old shoes. More recent ones might barely fit with some discomfort, but _Danielle_ really feels like trying to put baby shoes on my big toes and expecting that to be good enough.

### Will I change my name officially?

Maybe. I just might do it all at once and string [_Coco_](https://alexcoco.com) on the end.

### How can you help?

When you're unsure if someone knows about my name when speaking about me, casually inform them before going on as usual:

> {Danielle/Danii/Dani/D} changed their name to Delta.

Thank you!
