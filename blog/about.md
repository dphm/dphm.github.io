I'm **Danielle Pham**, a software developer intern at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). I received my BSc in Computer Science and Biology from [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca) in 2015, and spent a great summer at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) in 2014. I'm also an editor for [Code Words](http://codewords.recurse.com), a quarterly publication about programming.
