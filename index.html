                    <h2>About my pronouns</h2>
                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        D lives in Canada with <strong>their</strong> partner.<br>
                        I sat next to <strong>them</strong> at lunch.<br>
                        I thought the taco was mine, but it was actually <strong>theirs</strong>.<br>
                        Thankfully, <strong>they</strong> didn’t mind.<br>
                        <strong>They</strong> care about people other than <strong>themselves/themself</strong>.
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>The first time I heard about people using they/them pronouns as a gender-neutral alternative to he/him or she/her, I didn’t understand. My teachers convinced me that singular they was an incorrect grammar construct. It was hard for me to accept until I learned more about how language changes over time, and until one of my close friends began using they/them pronouns.</p>
                    <p>In Spring 2018, I met other non-binary and trans folks at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, who asked if I wanted them to try referring to me with they/them pronouns. Throughout my life I felt disconnected to the culture and assumptions around being a girl or woman, so shifting away from feminine pronouns felt right.</p>
                    <p>My partner, circles of friends, and people who work with me all refer to me with they/them pronouns. It sticks out when people don’t use them, and it causes me to overthink how I present myself publicly. Please consider she/her pronouns deprecated — my pronouns are they/them.</p>
                    <p>I’m not offended when mistakes are made, but it’s unlikely that I’ll correct anyone. I don’t need people to police others’ language on my behalf, but I appreciate the gentle reminders people have given each other to make my life a little easier. It’s totally okay to mess up while you’re getting used to it — catching yourself in the process still signals to me that you care. What makes me uncomfortable is prolonged usage of the wrong pronouns.</p>
                    <p>Thank you!</p>
