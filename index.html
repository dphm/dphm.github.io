  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Danielle</strong>. I love to create things that make people's lives more pleasant—often through code, arts and crafts, or music. Education, mental health, and code literacy are of particular interest to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I previously worked as a software developer at <a href="https://shopify.com" tabindex="-1">Shopify</a>, studied computer science and biology at <a href="https://mcgill.ca" tabindex="-1">McGill</a>, and attended the <a href="https://recurse.com" tabindex="-1">Recurse Center</a>. For more details, check out my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dnqdv95os474h5b/DaniellePham.pdf?dl=0" tabindex="-1">résumé</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning, travelling, writing, drawing, singing, playing board games, and solving puzzles are among my favourite activities. I appreciate local food, thought-provoking media, and empathetic people.
