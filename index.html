                <p>Hello! I'm D. I love to create things that make people's lives more pleasantâ€”often through code, arts and crafts, or music. Education, mental health, diversity and inclusion are particularly important to me.</p>
                <p>Learning, travelling, writing, drawing, singing, playing board games, and solving puzzles are among my favourite activities. I appreciate local food, thought-provoking media, and empathetic people.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to say <a href="mailto:danielle.pham@mail.mcgill.ca?subject=Hello">hello</a> if you'd like to chat!</p>
