My teachers convinced me that singular they was an incorrect grammar construct. It was hard for me to accept until I learned more about how language changes over time, and until one of my close friends began using they/them pronouns.</p>\n<p>In Spring 2018, I met other non-binary and trans folks at the <a href=\"https://recurse.com\">Recurse Center</a>, who asked if I wanted them to try referring to me with they/them pronouns. Throughout my life I felt disconnected to the culture and assumptions around being a girl or woman, so shifting away from feminine pronouns felt right.</p>\n<p>My partner, circles of friends, and people who work with me all refer to me with they/them pronouns. It sticks out when people donâ€™t use them, and it causes me to overthink how I present myself publicly. Please consider she/her pronouns deprecated â€” my pronouns are they/them.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m not offended when mistakes are made, but itâ€™s unlikely that Iâ€™ll correct anyone. I donâ€™t need people to police othersâ€™ language on my behalf, but I appreciate the gentle reminders people have given each other to make my life a little easier. Itâ€™s totally okay to mess up while youâ€™re getting used to it â€” catching yourself in the process still signals to me that you care. What makes me uncomfortable is prolonged usage of the wrong pronouns.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>","excerpt":"ðŸ—£ they/them/their Examples Delta lives in Canada with their partner.
