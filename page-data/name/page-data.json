What aspects of me are they judging? I change over time.</p>\n<h3>Deadnames</h3>\n<p>I’m not speaking on behalf of other trans people, who very often have valid reasons for not wanting to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming\">deadnamed</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d like to accept my younger self, who was <a href=\"https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/AFAB\">assigned female at birth</a>, socialized as a girl, and referred to as <em>Danielle</em> (or <em>Danii/Dani</em> to different people at different times). <em>Danielle</em> didn’t have the language to describe gender dysphoria, didn’t find representation, and didn’t have the space to experiment until adulthood.</p>\n<h2><em>D</em> was a placeholder</h2>\n<p>It actually started as <em>d</em> because I felt more like a <em>lowercase</em> person until I confronted myself about my ideas of self-worth. Then I became <em>D</em>. I was mainly aiming to remove gender from my name to reduce the chances of people making assumptions about my femininity before attempting to get to know me.</p>\n<p>Some people and software systems were confused, and didn’t consider <em>D</em> to be a valid name. I received UPS packages where the sender had to double the <em>D</em>. Who decided that a first name requires a length of at least two Latin characters?</p>\n<p>I knew I wasn’t going to be <em>D</em> forever, I just didn’t know what name I felt connected to, so I waited.</p>\n<h2>Time</h2>\n<p>My brain was still active after finishing <em>Minor Feelings</em> by <a href=\"http://www.cathyparkhong.com/books\">Cathy Park Hong</a>. I thought about the impending name collision when my coworker Di would return from parental leave. After thinking of a handful of options, Delta came to me, and I felt a moment of pure <a href=\"https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_Euphoria\">gender euphoria</a> and excitement.</p>\n<h2>Delta represents change</h2>\n<p>I read <em>Parable of the Sower</em> by Octavia E. Butler, in which Lauren Olamina writes, “God is change.” Again, I don’t believe in God, but I do have my own way of connecting to something beyond myself.</p>\n<p>The universe is vastly complex: creative, destructive, transformative. I believe I came to exist by coincidence, by some particular circumstances governed by the nature of physics and entropy. I am what I am through processes of evolution and adaptation of the human species over generations.</p>\n<p>I’m also a math nerd, and triangles are tastier. Δ ■</p>\n<h2>You, me, and others</h2>\n<h3>What if you still call me <em>Danielle/Danii/Dani/D</em>?</h3>\n<p>I don’t control your actions, and you can choose to do whatever you please, but not without consequences. I view the acceptance and use of my chosen name as an act of care. If I were to insist on calling you by a name you didn’t feel connected to, you might also feel disconnected from me.</p>\n<p>I’ve outgrown these names like old shoes. More recent ones might barely fit with some discomfort, but <em>Danielle</em> really feels like trying to put baby shoes on my big toes and expecting that to be good enough.</p>\n<h3>Will I change my name officially?</h3>\n<p>Maybe. I just might do it all at once and string <a href=\"https://alexcoco.com\"><em>Coco</em></a> on the end.</p>\n<h3>How can you help?</h3>\n<p>When you’re unsure if someone knows about my name when speaking about me, casually inform them before going on as usual:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>{Danielle/Danii/Dani/D} changed their name to Delta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you!</p>","excerpt":"I change over time.
